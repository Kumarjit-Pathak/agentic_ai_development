## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the multi-agent system created for the Optimizer Insight project using the Claude Code SDK. The system is based on the architectural patterns demonstrated in the [claude-code-hooks-mastery](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery) repository, implementing specialized sub-agents for retail optimization and constraint analysis tasks.

## Architecture

### System Design Principles

The multi-agent system follows these core principles derived from the reference implementation:

1. **Specialization**: Each agent has a focused domain of expertise
2. **Coordination**: A meta-agent orchestrates complex workflows
3. **Modularity**: Agents can work independently or collaboratively
4. **Extensibility**: New agents can be added without system restructure
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and quality control

```python
# Example routing patterns
data_keywords = ["data", "excel", "csv", "constraint", "analysis"]
dashboard_keywords = ["streamlit", "dashboard", "ui", "visualization"]
optimization_keywords = ["optimization", "algorithm", "mathematical", "model"]
research_keywords = ["research", "statistical", "modeling", "hypothesis", "bayesian"]
ml_keywords = ["machine learning", "deep learning", "neural network", "ml", "dl", "ai", "genai"]
```

      "priority": 1
    }
    // ... other agents
  },
  "hooks": {
    "agent-router": {

      "priority": 1
    }
    // ... other hooks
  },

    "data_keywords": ["data", "excel", "csv"],
    "complex_task_threshold": 3
  },
  "security": {
    "enable_validation": true,
    "block_dangerous_patterns": true
  }
}
```

## Implementation Philosophy

### Based on claude-code-hooks-mastery Patterns

The implementation follows key patterns from the reference repository:

1. **Markdown Agent Definitions**: Each agent is defined as a markdown file with clear capabilities and responsibilities
2. **Hook-Driven Lifecycle**: Hooks provide deterministic control over agent behavior and interactions
3. **Modular Architecture**: Independent components that can be composed for complex workflows
4. **Security-First Approach**: Built-in validation and security measures
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automated quality checking and enforcement

### Agent Specialization Strategy

Each agent is designed with:
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope of responsibility
- **Domain Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific technical areas
- **Collaborative Interfaces**: Ability to work with other agents
- **Quality Standards**: Consistent output quality and validation

### Workflow Coordination

The system supports:
- **Sequential Workflows**: Step-by-step task execution
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent agent execution
- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Meta-agent oversight and management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and reporting

## Reference Framework

This implementation is inspired by and follows patterns from:
- **Repository**: [claude-code-hooks-mastery](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery)
- **Author**: disler
- **Key Concepts**: Hook lifecycle management, agent specialization, deterministic control

### Adaptations for Optimizer Insight

The system has been specifically adapted for:
- **Retail Optimization Domain**: Constraint analysis, space optimization
- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboard development, data visualization
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Optimization algorithms, constraint satisfaction
- **Data Processing**: Excel files, constraint mappings, analytics

### Extension Points

The system is designed for easy extension:
- **New Agents**: Add markdown files in `.claude/agents/`
- **New Hooks**: Add Python scripts in `.claude/hooks/`
- **Configuration**: Modify `.claude/config.json`
- **Routing Rules**: Extend keyword and pattern matching

## Next Steps

1. **Agent Testing**: Validate each agent's functionality
2. **Integration Testing**: Test multi-agent workflows
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize hook execution and routing
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed usage guides
5. **Extension Development**: Add domain-specific agents as needed

This multi-agent system provides a robust, extensible foundation for complex optimization and analysis workflows while maintaining clean separation of concerns and high code quality standards.
